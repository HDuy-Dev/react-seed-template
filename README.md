### Project Structure 🗂️

The project is organized into the following structure for scalability and maintainability:

```
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── app/                # Main application logic and pages
│   ├── assets/             # Static assets like images, fonts, etc.
│   ├── components/        # Reusable React components
│   ├── utils/             # Utility functions and helpers
│   ├── config/            # Configuration files for the project
│   ├── features/          # Feature-specific modules
│   ├── hooks/             # Custom React hooks
│   ├── lib/               # Shared libraries and modules
│   ├── test/              # Test utilities and mock data
```

### Absolute Path Setup 🔑

The project has been pre-configured to use absolute paths. You can import modules from the `src` folder using the `@` alias. For example:

```javascript
import Button from '@/components/Button';
import useFetch from '@/hooks/useFetch';
```

## Usage 📦

To create a new project using this template, run the following command:

```bash
npx react-seed-template [project-name]
```

Replace `[project-name]` with the desired name of your new project.

The command will:

1. Clone this template repository.
2. Set up the project in the specified folder.
3. Install dependencies using `yarn`.

Once the setup is complete, you can navigate to the project folder and start the development server:

```bash
cd [project-name]
yarn dev
```

Your project is now ready to use!

## ⚠️ Node.js Version Requirement

Ensure that you have **Node.js >= 20.0.0** installed. You can verify your Node.js version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

If needed, you can install the required version using [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or another method.
